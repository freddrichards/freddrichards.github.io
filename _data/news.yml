- headline: "<a href='/documents/papers/ghelichkhan_etal_2025_gji.pdf'>New paper alert!</a> Led by Sia Ghelichkhan, this paper uses state-of-the-art 'adjoint' mantle flow reconstructions and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) modelling to show that mantle convection accounts for ≤30% of the present-day rate and direction of true polar wander (the rotation of the solid Earth with respect to its spin axis), with ~70% attributable to ongoing GIA responses to the Last Deglaciation. Congratulations to the rest of the team: Mark Hoggard, Erik Chan, J.C. Creveling, Kimee Moore and Jerry Mitrovica!"

- headline: "<a href='/documents/papers/richards_etal_2023_sciadv.pdf'>New paper alert!</a> By correcting ancient shoreline elevation across Australia for mantle-flow-driven vertical motions, we obtain a more accurate estimate of global mean sea level during the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period (~3 million years ago). This new estimate implies that some recent high-end sea-level projections may be excessively pessimistic but is consistent with mid-range forecasts. Many thanks to my amazing team of co-authors---Sophie Coulson, Mark Hoggard, Jacky Austermann, Blake Dyer and Jerry Mitrovica---for all their help!"

- headline: "<a href='/documents/papers/richards_etal_2023_epsl.pdf'>New paper alert!</a> By reconciling a suite of geodynamic, geodetic, seismic, and geochemical constraints, we show that the basal sections of LLVPs likely contain a 100–200 km thick layer of dense material, whose physical properties are most compatible those expected for remnants of Earth's early crust. We also find that long-wavelength thermal anomalies associated with LLVPs extend no more than 900 km depth above the CMB. Many thanks to Mark Hoggard, Sia Ghelichkhan, Paula Koelemeijer, and Harriet Lau for their help with this one!"

- headline: "<a href='/documents/papers/richards_etal_2022_nature_inreview.pdf'>New preprint alert!</a> This paper analyses the elevation of Australian sea-level indicators from the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP; ~3 million years ago), the last time in Earth history that atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature levels were similar to those predicted in the near-future. By accurately correcting for the post-depositional deflection of these palaeo sea-level markers induced by mantle dynamics, we are able to determine that global mean sea levels were somewhat lower in the MPWP than estimated in recent studies, implying a more stable Antarctic Ice Sheet and effectively ruling out the most pessimistic recent projections of 21st century sea-level rise."
