<h3 style="font-weight: bold">Effect of Mantle Dynamics on Palaeoclimate</h3>

<p style="padding-top:5px">
The study of ice age palaeoclimate has tended to assume – with the exception of glacial isostatic adjustment and localised tectonic activity – that Earth’s surface has remained a passive, non-deforming substrate. This common assumption is undermined by the existence of rapidly evolving dynamic topography and we may need to revise our present understanding of certain climatic periods, especially those that occurred millions of years before present. The mid-Pliocene warm period (MPWP; ~3 million years ago) is of particular interest as it represents the last time in Earth history that atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were similar to the present. Estimates of sea-level during this time are therefore used to tune ice sheet models and sea-level forecasts. However, uncertainty on these estimates is currently large due to the wide range of MPWP palaeoshoreline elevations (~15–65 m) and this spread is likely caused, at least in part, by changes in dynamic topography. In certain locations where agreement between model predictions and observations is good, it may be possible to correct palaeoshoreline elevations for dynamic topography to get more accurate constraints on global mean sea-level during this critical period.

In addition to its effect on mid-Pliocene sea-level records, the impact of dynamic topography changes on the intrinsic stability of continental ice sheets during this time is an important area of research. Decreases in bedrock elevation can result in an inland retreat of ice-sheet grounding lines (i.e., where the ice sheet loses contact with basement rocks and begins to float), reducing the ice storage capacity of the continents, and it has been suggested that this may be partly responsible for higher sea-levels during the MPWP. By contrast, uplift can help to stabilise ice sheets and may even help to trigger their formation by modifying atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns.
<br/><br/>
Developing a full understanding of the impact of dynamic topography on surface processes will require a lot more work, and large uncertainties on the internal viscosity and density structure of the mantle remain. However, expansion of palaeotopographic data compilations and integration of these constraints with sophisticated inverse modelling techniques will allow us to steadily refine our knowledge of past mantle states and rheology. It will not be long before we can start to give more definitive answers to the palaeoclimate questions outlined above and many more.

Despite significant advances in our ability to image the deep mantle using seismological techniques, establishing the buoyancy and rheology of identified wave speed anomalies---such as the continent-sized *large low velocity provinces* (LLVPs)---is complicated by uncertainties in lower mantle composition and the amplitude of seismic attenuation. However, determining the density and viscosity structure of these features is fundamental to improving our understanding of mantle flow patterns and associated deflections of Earth's core-mantle boundary and surface.
<br/><br/>
By reconciling multiple novel and independent geodynamic, geodetic, and seismic observations, including revised estimates of Earth's dynamic topography, semi-diurnal body tide deformation, and Stoneley mode splitting function measurements, we have shown that the deepest ~150&nbsp;km of the LLVPs comprise compositionally distinct and relatively dense material. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that this dense basal layer likely consists of an iron-enriched basaltic component derived from early-formed oceanic crust. This anomalous chemistry may provide an explanation for both the inferred long-term stability of LLVPs and the primordial isotope signatures of ocean island basalts generated by plumes that rise from these regions. Our proposed model of deep Earth structure therefore satisfies geochemical constraints on Earth's internal heterogeneity, in addition to the full range of available geophysical observations.
<br/><br/>
This joint inversion approach shows great promise and will be augmented in future to assess three-dimensional variations in mantle viscosity, the time-dependent evolution of lower mantle structure and its impact on surface processes.

<!--The density field of the mantle is a key parameter in constraining the dynamics of mantle flow. We have set out to understand mantle density by appealing to a much-neglected geophysical process, namely solid Earth tides. Predicting the deformation of the solid Earth in response to periodic luni-solar forcings has a rich history in classical physics, with theoretical work dating back to Newton. The advent of modern space geodetic methods (e.g., surveying using the Global Positioning System) has yielded unprecedented constraints on solid Earth tidal deformation and revealed geographical variations in body tide deformation at the sub-mm level. These variations are indicative of heterogeneity in mantle buoyancy and elastic structure.-->

<!--Using a tidal theory we developed, we have shown that the deepest parts of the mantle beneath African and the Pacific are characterized by negative buoyancy. Such a result holds implications for the compositional distribution of the mantle, which in turn provides information on the primordial state of the mantle, and its ongoing evolution and how efficiently the mantle mixes. This initial application shows the great promise of “tidal tomography” in elucidating deep mantle buoyancy structure and there are many directions to be taken (e.g., augmenting data to include many types of tides, joint inversions with more conventional data, further generalizing the theory to allow for more complicated processes).-->
