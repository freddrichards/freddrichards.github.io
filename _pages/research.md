<h3 style="font-weight: bold">Research overview</h3> 
<p style="padding-top:10px">
After the  brief research overview, below, check out the images for examples of recent or currently active projects.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold">1 - Global geodynamics</h3>
<p style="padding-top:10px">
We develop methods to place plate boundaries, and particularly subduction zones, into a global framework. Ultimately, we strive to isolate the two-way interactions that occur between individual plate boundaries and global-scale mantle circulation.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold">2 - Regional subduction dynamics</h3>
<p style="padding-top:10px">
We utilize a variety of modeling approaches to develop an understanding of how subduction zones operate, in general and within particular regions. Recent regions of focus include the complex subduction settings of the Western Pacific and Caribbean.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold">3 - Plate kinematics and plate reconstructions</h3>
<p style="padding-top:10px">
We utilize plate kinematics and plate reconstructions to evalute simple mechanical models for tectonic observables.
