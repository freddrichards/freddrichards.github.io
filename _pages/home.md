Welcome!

I am an Imperial College Research Fellow interested in all aspects of geodynamics but with a particular focus on how mantle flow and structure interacts with surface processes, especially ice sheet stability, landscape evolution, and mineral deposit formation. This research involves a mixture of computational modelling and acquisition of new data sets, with the ultimate aim of building a more complete 4D picture of Earth's evolution.

Ongoing projects include deciphering how Earth's internal dynamics affect estimates of past and future sea-level change; using records of erosion and sedimentation to reconstruct how the pattern of mantle flow has changed over time; and understanding the link between lithospheric structure and the formation 'supergiant' sediment-hosted mineral deposits.

If you have any interest in working with me as part of your undergraduate, graduate or post-doctoral research, I encourage you to get in touch.
