Welcome to my website!

I am an Imperial College Research Fellow interested in all aspects of geodynamics but with a particular focus on how mantle flow and internal structure interacts with surface processes, especially landscape evolution, ice sheet stability and mineral deposit formation. This research involves a mixture of computational modelling and acquisition of new datasets, with the ultimate aim of building a more complete 4D picture of Earth's evolution.

If you have any interest in working with me as part of your undergraduate, graduate or post-doctoral research, I encourage you to get in touch.
